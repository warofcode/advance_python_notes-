    "• Identifier is the name given to entities like class, functions, variables , modules and any other object in Python.\n",
    "• Rules for identifiers:\n",
    "• Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_)\n",
    "• No special character except underscore is allowed in the name of a variable\n",
    "• It must compulsorily begin with a underscore ( _ ) or a letter and not with a digit . Although after the first letter we can have as many digits as we want. So 1a is invalid , while a1 or _a or _1 is a valid name for an identifier.\n",
    " \n",
    "• Identifiers are case sensitive , so pi and Pi are two different identifiers.\n",
    " \n",
    "• Keywords cannot be used as identifiers\n",
    "• Identifier can be of any length.\n",
    " \n",
    "Rules For Reserved Words\n",

    "• A word in a programming language which has a fixed meaning and cannot be redefined by the programmer or used as identifiers\n",

    "• Mapping Type\n",
    "• None Type\n",
    "• Given on the next slide are the names of actual data types belonging to the above mentioned categories\n",
    " \n",
    "• Before we explore more about these data types , let us understand following important points regarding Python’s data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DATA TYPES IN PYTHON ARE DYNAMIC\n",
    "2. SIZE OF THE DATA TYPE IS ALSO DYNAMICALLY MANAGED\n",
    "3. DATA TYPES ARE UNBOUNDED\n",
    " \n",
    "1. DATA TYPES IN PYTHON ARE DYNAMIC\n",
    "\n",
    "• The term dynamic means that we can assign different values to the same variable at different points of time.\n",
    "• Python will dynamically change the type of variable as per the value given.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. SIZE OF THE DATA TYPE IS ALSO DYNAMICALLY MANAGED\n",
    "\n",
    "• In Python the size of  data types is dynamically managed\n",
    "• Like C/C++/Java language , variables in Python are not of fixed size.\n",
    "• Python makes them as big as required on demand\n",
    "• There is no question of how much memory a variable uses in Python because this memory increases as per the value being assigned\n",
    "• Python starts with initial size for a variable and then increases its size as needed up to the RAM limit\n",
    "• This initial size for int is 24 bytes and then increases as the value is increased\n",
    "• If we want to check the size of a variable , then Python provides us a function called getsizeof() .\n",
    "• This function is available in a module called sys\n",
    " \n",
    "3. DATA TYPES ARE UNBOUNDED\n",
    "\n",
    "• Third important rule to remember is that  , in Python data types like integers don’t have any range i.e. they are unbounded\n",
    "• Like C /C++ /Java they don’t have max or min value\n",
    "• So an int variable can store as many digits as we want. \n",

    "Two Very Important Questions\n",
    "•Keeping in mind the concept of immutability , 2 very common questions arise :\n",
    "•What is the benefit of making objects immutable ? \n",
    "&\n",
    "•If we have a single reference and we create multiple objects , then wouldn’t there be  memory wastage ?\n",
    "Qn 1 : Benefit Of Immutability\n",
    "•The main benefit of immutability is that , it prevents unnecessary creation of new objects .\n",
    "•This is because if we write , the following 2 statements:\n",
    "a=42\n",
    "b=42\n",
    "•Then Python will not create 2 objects . Rather it only creates 1 object and makes both the references a and b ,refer to the same object.\n",
    "•This saves memory and overhead  of creating multiple objects \n",
    "Qn 2 : What About Single Reference And Multiple Objects ?\n",
    "•Consider the following 3 lines :\n",
    "a=10 a=20 a=30\n",
    "•When the above 3 lines will run , then Python will create 3 objects , one by one and finally the reference a will refer to the last object with the value 30\n",
    "•An obvious question arises , that what will happen to the previous 2 objects with the value 10 and 20 ?\n",
    "Three Important Terms \n",
    "•Before understanding , what will happen to the previous 2 objects , we need to understand 3 important terminologies:\n",
    "1.Garbage Block \n",
    "2.The Garbage Collection\n",
    "3.Reference Counting\n",
    "The Garbage Block\n",
    "•In Python , if an object is not being referred by any reference , then such objects are called Garbage Blocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Garbage Block \n",
    "\n",
    "The Garbage Collection\n",
    "•Garbage collection is the process of cleaning the computer memory which was used by a running program when that program no longer needs that memory .\n",
    "•Garbage collection is a memory management feature in many programming languages.\n",
    " \n",
    "•The process of memory management in Python is straightforward. \n",
    "•Python handles it’s objects by keeping a count to the number of references each object has in the program.\n",
    "•In simple words it means, each object stores how many references are currently referring it.\n",
    "•This count is updated with the program runtime and when it reaches 0, this means it is not reachable from the program anymore. \n",
    "•Hence, the memory for this object can be reclaimed and be freed by the interpreter.\n",
    "a=10   // The object 10 has a reference count of 1 b=10  // Now 10 has reference count of 2 a=20 // Now reference count of 10 becomes 1 b=20 // Finally reference count of 10 becomes 0\n",
    "•As soon as the reference count of 10 becomes 0 , Python automatically removes the object 10 from memory \n",
    "•So in our example\n",
    "a=10 a=20 a=30\n",
    "•The objects 10 and 20 will be reclaimed by the Python Garbage Collector as soon as their reference count becomes 0\n",
    "•ADVANTAGE:\n",
    "•The main advantage of such approach is that unused memory is reclaimed and made available for use again.\n",
    "•DISADVANTAGE:\n",
    "•The drawback is that Python has to continuously watch the reference count of objects in the background and free them as soon as reference count becomes 0.\n",
    "•This is another important reason why Python is slow as compared to other languages\n",
    " \n",
    "Another Important Question\n",
    "•Consider the following statements:\n",
    "a=42 b=42\n",
    "•Can you tell how many objects has Python created in the above code ?\n",
    "•Answer: Only 1\n",
    "•But , what is the proof ?\n",
    "Another Important Question\n",
    "•We can prove this in 2 ways:\n",
    "•By using id( ) function \n",
    "•By using is operator\n",
    "The id( ) Function\n",
    "•id() is a built-in function in Python 3, which returns the identity of an object. \n",
    "•The identity is a unique integer for that object during it’s lifetime. \n",
    "•This is also the address of the object in memory.\n",
    "The id( ) Function\n",
    "•We can use the id( ) function to prove that whenever we assign the same value to a variable then Python simply assigns the address of existing object to the new reference.\n",
    " \n",
    "The is Operator\n",
    "•Another way to find out whether 2 references are pointing to the same object or not is to use the is operator.\n",
    "•The is operator is a binary operator and checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not.\n",
    "The is Operator\n",
    " \n",
    "An Important Twist !\n",

    "a= -5 b=-5\n",
    "print(a is b)\n",

    "False\n",
    "Python caches the integer values in the range -5 to 256 . \n",
    "Beyond this range Python creates new objects even for the same value\n",

    "•How to create constants in Python ?\n",
    "•How to print a variables value using print( ) ?\n",
    "Comments In Python\n",
    "•Comments are statements in our program which are ignored by the compiler or interpreter i.e they are not executed by the language\n",
    "•We generally create comments to let developers understand our code’s logic.\n",
    "•This is a necessary practice, and good developers make heavy use of the comment system. \n",
    "•Without it, things can get confusing\n",
    " \n",
    "Types Of Comments In Python\n",
    "•Python provides 2 types of comments:\n",
    "•Single Line Comment ( official way of comment)\n",
    "•MultiLine Comment ( un offcial way)\n",
    "Single Line Comments\n",
    "•Single-line comments are created simply by beginning a line with the hash (#) character, and they are automatically terminated by the end of line.\n",
    "•For example:\n",
    "a=10\n",
    "#a=a+1 \n",
    "print(a) Output:\n",
    "10\n",
    "Official Way Of Multi Line Comments\n",
    "•To create a Multi Line Comments , the only problem with this style is we will have prefix each line with # , as shown below:\n",
    "#a=a+1\n",
    "#b=b+5\n",
    "#c=c+10\n",
    "•But most Python projects follow this style and Python’s PEP 8 style guide also favours repeated single-line comments.\n",
    "What Is PEP ?\n",
    "•PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.\n",
    "•It is Python's style guide and is officially called PEP8\n",
    "•In simple words it is a set of rules for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability .\n",
    "•We can find it at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\n",
    "Why Is PEP Needed ?\n",
    "•When you develop a program in a group of programmers, it is really important to follow some standards. \n",
    "•If all team members format the code in the same prescribed format, then it is much easier to read the code. \n",
    "•For the same purpose PEP8 is used to ensure Python coding standards are met.\n",
    "Un Official Way Of Multi Line Comments\n",
    "•If  we want to simplify our efforts for writing Multi Line Comments , then we can wrap these comments inside triple quotes ( double or single ) as shown below\n",
    "•For example:\n",
    "a=10\n",
    "' ' ' a=a+1 a=a+1  ' ' ' print(a) Output:\n",
    "10\n",
    "Why It Is Un Official ?\n",
    "•Triple quotes doesn’t create “true” comments.\n",
    "•They are regular multiline strings , but since they are not getting assigned to any variable , they will get garbage collected as soon as the code runs.\n",
    "•Hence they are not ignored by the interpreter in the same way that #a comment is.\n",
    "What Is A Constant ?\n",
    "•A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.\n",
    "•C++ provides the keyword const for declaring constant as shown below:\n",
    "const float pi=3.14; pi=5.0; // Syntax Error\n",
    "•Java provides the keyword final for declaring constant:\n",
    "final double PI=3.14; PI=5.0; // Syntax Error\n",
    "How To Create A Constant In Python?\n",
    "•Unfortunately , there is no keyword in Python , like const or final , to declare a variable as constant.\n",
    "•This is because of dynamic nature of Python .\n",
    "•However there is a convention in Python , that we can follow to let other developer’s know that we are declaring a variable as constant and we don’t want others to change it’s value.\n",
    "•The convention is to declare the variable in all upper case\n",
    "How To Create A Constant In Python?\n",
    "•For example:\n",
    "PI=3.14\n",
    "MAX_MARKS=100\n",
    "•But again , remember this is just a convention not a rule and still the value of PI and MAX_MARKS can be changed\n",
    "Some More About print( ) Function\n",
    "•We know that print( ) function can be used to print messages on the output screen.\n",
