In this case, a weather application right from scratch and can be deployed in any cloud platform. This document takes a simple example of a weather application process from scratch and shows recent 5 city search of weather. \n"

    "`Weather forecasting` is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given `location` and `time`. People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.\n",
